# Getting Started

In order to get the most out of the system you need 3 things in place.

1. Daily Commitment Journal
1. One or more Accomplishment Tracker™ Pages or Notebooks
1. Review Cycle Grids

Below are summaries of each of these things. Once you have these in place. Only 1 more thing
remains, a daily routine. Read more about [Daily Routine](../the-system/daily-routine), it's 
one of the secrets to success.

## Daily Commitment Journal

Having a daily commitment journal and routine is crucial for success. For this journal, you can use just about anything that you feel comfortable with for this. Most "Todo List" applications can work, but to be completely honest, a $.50 composition notebook works very well. 

Here are the rules, if you use a simple notebook:
1. Each day dedicate 1 page for your `Commitment List` (Some people call this a todo list).
1. Each day dedicate 1 page for `Daily Notes` for that day.

As you plan your day, you commit to things you can get done that day with the 
time you have, writing them on the daily commitment list. As people ask you to 
do things, and you think you can complete it that day, you add it to your
commitment list. If you don't think you can honestly get to it today, then you add it to a 
future day's page.

As you use your daily commitment list more and more, you may find it useful to have 
bookmarks for `Today` and `Tomorrow` so, you can easily find your place 
throughout the day, and week.

## Accomplishment Tracker™ Pages and Notebooks

Accomplishment Tracker™ pages and notebooks are tools to help you keep 
track of your progress for a particular initiative that you are working on.
For things that are smaller, you can just use one page, and for bigger
projects that might take months or years to accomplish, you probably need 
a notebook or binder. 

Following the Accomplishment Pattern, here are the sections of an Accomplishment Tracker™ page or notebook:
1. Dream
1. Learn
1. Plan
1. Do

The following is a summary of the purpose of each and how you use them.

### Dream

The section of the page or notebook contains:
* Dream Statement
  * 1-3 Sentences explaining your vision for what you want to acheive.
* Success Criteria
  * List of things that will need to be in place for you to feel satisfied at 
the end.
* Team Members List
  * If you are working with more than yourself, or other people will be 
 helping, listing them can help.
* A Review Cycle
  * This is how often you will review the dream, the plan, and commit to work 
 on something.
  * Choose Daily, Weekly, or Monthly

### Learn

This learn section is just an open place for capturing anything important as you learn or create things. We list any resources that we have, or will need, to work through a plan.

### Plan

The Plan is the where you keep track of what main steps need to be taken. As 
you learn what needs to be done, the path to success presents itself, and you
capture that in Milestones and Goals that need to be reached, and Tasks that 
will need to be complete to get to your success criteria.

The Plan section is important to review regularly, as you commit to tasks, and
learn more about your overall dream. This section holds the 
"State of your Dream," meaning that at anytime, you can glance at this section 
and see what has been done, and what there is left to do.

### Do

The Do section is all about recording progress, in the form of Commitments and Progress Logs. As you commit to things that you can do that will move your plan along, you can record that commitment in the Commitments List, and as you make progress with something, you can write a little blub in the progress log about the progress that was made. This is especially great for projects where you are working with a group of people. The Do section is meant to be a logs of notes and comments from yourself or the team that is working through.

## Review Cycle Grids

A Review Cycle Grid is a spreadsheet type list of your Accomplishment Tracker™ 
pages and notebooks that you need to review at different intervals. 

There are 3 main Review Cycle Grids
1. Daily Review Cycle
   * List of Daily Trackers that have a box for each day of the month
   * Create a new Daily Review Cycle Grid each month
2. Weekly Review Cycle
   * List of Week Trackers that has a Day of the Week you will review, and a box for each of the weeks for half a year, 26 weeks
   * Create a new Weekly Review Cycle Grid every 6 months
3. Monthly Review Cycle
   * List of Monthly Trackers that has a Day of the month, and a box for each month in a year
   * Create a new Monthly Review Cycle Grid every year
