                    <h1 id="the-accomplishment-system">The Accomplishment System</h1>
<p>The Accomplishment System is a collection of principles and tools that faciliate efficient progress towards a specific outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#priciples">Principles</a></li>
<li><a href="#tools">Tools</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<h3 id="principle-1---if-you-want-things-to-change-you-must-do-something-different">Principle #1 - If you want things to change, you must do something different</h3>
<p>This principle may sound a bit cliche, but we often have to remind those that we train that there are often no short cuts to improvement. Steady and consistent change of behavior is what changes results. There is also an important lesson contained in this statement... who is it that wants something to change? You. So YOU must do something different. There is no blame game embeded in this statement.</p>
<h3 id="principle-2---focusing-on-outcomes-will-bring-you-better-results">Principle #2 - Focusing on outcomes will bring you better results</h3>
<p>It is no accident that DREAM is the first step in the pattern. Being able to articulate the vision behind your motivation, and being able to define what you will consider a sucessful outcome is the most important step you can take. Without a clear end goal, you are most certainly going to go the wrong direction. It's ok to have that vision differ as time goes on, as you learn you may see things more clearly, so we pivot, and keep moving towards a clearer goal marker ahead.</p>
<h3 id="principle-3---commitments-are-more-powerful-than-assignments">Principle #3 - Commitments are more powerful than assignments</h3>
<p>When we and those in our team commit to do specific things, it holds more weight if something simple gets assigned. It's not always clear what steps are needed to get something done, and so commiting to a specific step is always a better idea, rather than assigning a task. </p>
<h3 id="principle-4---ownership-cultivates-creativity">Principle #4 - Ownership cultivates creativity</h3>
<p>When we take responsibility for the outcomes that we see in our vision of a future state, we open the door to creativity. When we ask ourselves, &quot;what can I do to move this along?&quot; magic happens.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<h3 id="tool-1---daily-commitment-journal">Tool #1 - Daily Commitment Journal</h3>
<p>The Daily Commitment Journal or your Daily Log for short, can be as simple as a notebook in which you keep the commitments you have made.</p>
<h3 id="tool-2---the-accomplishment-tracker-notebooks-and-pages">Tool #2 - The Accomplishment Tracker™ Notebooks and Pages</h3>
<p>Accomplishment Tracker™ notebooks and pages, known as &quot;Trackers&quot; are a documentation devices that allows you to track what you are trying to get done. They have a specfific format that we have found that facilitates progress. Read more about <a href="the-system/accomplishment-tracker">Accomplishment Tracker™</a> to get started.</p>
<h3 id="tool-3---review-cycle-grids">Tool #3 - Review Cycle Grids</h3>
<p>Review Cycle Grids are simple spreadsheet layouts that can be used to keep track of which Trackers you need to review today. There is a Daily Grid, Weekly Grid, and a Monthly Grid. As part of your <a href="the-system/daily-routine">Daily Routine</a> you mark off if you have reviewed the corresponding tracker for that Review Cycle (i.e. day, week, month, or year).</p>
<h3 id="tool-4---playbooks">Tool #4 - Playbooks</h3>
<p>Accomplishment Tracker™ Playbooks are a formalized Tracker document that outlines the steps for a standardized process. It outlines the objective, outcomes, with main process outlines so that each step can be referenced. These are commonly used for known things that you have to do daily or weekly, like processing payments, creating a dashboard for a sales meeting, etc.</p>
