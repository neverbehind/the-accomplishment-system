## Daily Commitment Journal

Having a daily commitment journal and routine is crucial for success. For this journal, you can use just about anything that you feel comfortable with for this. Most "Todo List" applications can work, but to be completely honest, a $.50 composition notebook works very well. 

Here are the rules, if you use a simple notebook:
1. Each day dedicate 1 page for your `Commitment List` (Some people call this a todo list).
1. Each day dedicate 1 page for `Daily Notes` for that day.

As you plan your day, you commit to things you can get done that day with the 
time you have, writing them on the daily commitment list. As people ask you to 
do things, and you think you can complete it that day, you add it to your
commitment list. If you don't think you can honestly get to it today, then you add it to a 
future day's page.

As you use your daily commitment list more and more, you may find it useful to have 
bookmarks for `Today` and `Tomorrow` so, you can easily find your place 
throughout the day, and week.
