                    <h1 id="your-daily-routine">Your Daily Routine</h1>
<p>To be successful with the system, there is a daily routine that you have to make a habit. </p>
<p>Each day, you need to get your commitment list ready based on yesterday's list, any dreams
and goals that you are working on, and any other commitments that you have made (i.e.
Family, Work, School, etc) </p>
<h2 id="yesterdays-commitments">Yesterday's Commitments</h2>
<p>When you don't get all the things done that you committed to, you need to decide whether to
move them to today's list, or based on the amount of commitments you have, maybe you need to
move them to a future day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the purposes of the Daily Commitment Journal is to help you <em>not commit</em> to too much stuff. As
you use it day after day, you will notice that some of the tasks are bigger and you will
need to focus on them for a significant portion of the day. So, if someone asks you to help
with something else, you will develop a habit of checking your daily commitments page for the day
before you commit to them, and maybe say &quot;Sorry, I don't have time to today, but I can
definitely help on Wednesday.&quot; You then write the commitment on Wednesday's page, rather than
adding something to today's list that you will just have to end of moving anyways.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="accomplishment-tracker-review-cycles">Accomplishment Tracker™ Review Cycles</h2>
<p>Based on the Accomplishment Tracker™ pages and notebooks that you have made, and recorded on your
Review Cycle Grids, each day you need to review all 3</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily </li>
<li>Weekly (for today's day of the week)</li>
<li>Monthly (for today's day of the month)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For each of the Accomplishment Tracker™ review cycles, you will read through your DREAM, LEARN,
and PLAN sections committing to the next step in the plan. Recording what you committed to do in the commitment section.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="other-commitments">Other Commitments</h2>
<p>Our relationships with others are not generally something we have an Accomplishment Tracker™ page
for, but it's important to add them to your commitment list for the day. Personal and family
relationships need to be nurtured and commitments need to be kept to build trust and unity. So,
make sure that you capture those commitments in your list as well as you review your day.</p>
<h2 id="calendar-events">Calendar Events</h2>
<p>If you are someone that uses a calendar, then during your daily routine it's good to note that you have certain things on your calendar, because that may effect the time you have for other commitments.</p>
