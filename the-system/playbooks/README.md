## Playbook Sections

### Objective

Like the dream section in a Tracker, this section is to capture the objective of this playbook is.

### Artifacts

Artifacts are measurable or tangible things that are produced by a particular process.

### Review Cycle

Similar to the review cycle of a tracker, some play books are long living like a tracker, and it's best to review them on a set interval. 

### Resources

In the resources section we list the things that will be needed to work through this playbook.

### Team

The team section of a playbook is used to identify the roles that needed, and a place to fill in the names of the people that will fulfill that role.

### Process & Tasks

The processes and tasks section is used to capture the meat of the playbook. The question we are answering in this section is: What must be done to produce the artifacts?

### Scheduling & Dependencies

If there are any scheduling or sequencing information or notes they can go here. E.g. if some previous playbook needs to be completed in order for this one to be worked on.
