<blockquote>
<p>When it's not as simple as just getting it done... you probably could use a tracker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are things that we need to do that require more time, require more people,
and have more than a couple steps. We may have a meeting, where we discuss the
issues that we are facing come up with a plan, and divide <strong>to</strong> conquer. Notice
I didn't say divide <strong>and</strong> conquer. Because we plan, divvy up some tasks, and
divide going our separate ways commiting <strong>to do</strong> the things that are necessary
for success.</p>
<p>To reach the other side of the hill and arrive as conquerers - that takes more than
just hope and good intentions. This is where The Accomplishment System helps
to close the gap.</p>
<p>An Accomplishment Tracker™ page and notebook is a tool within the System to assit
you keep track of your progress for a particular thing that you are trying to achieve.
For things that are smaller, you can just use one page, and for bigger
projects that might take months or years to accomplish, you probably need
a notebook or binder. </p>
<p>Following the Accomplishment Pattern, here are the parts of an Accomplishment Tracker™ page or notebook:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dream</li>
<li>Learn</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Do</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dream">Dream</h2>
<p>The section of the tracker contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dream Statement
<ul>
<li>1-3 Sentences explaining your vision for what you want to acheive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Success Criteria
<ul>
<li>List of things that will need to be in place for you to feel satisfied at
the end</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Team Members List
<ul>
<li>If you are working with more than yourself, or other people will be
helping, listing them can help.
<blockquote>
<p>If you are working as a team. You will also need to designate the owner of the tracker. This person will be responsible for reviewing the tracker each review cycle.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Review Cycle
<ul>
<li>This is how often you will review the dream, the plan, and commit to work
on something.</li>
<li>Choose Daily, Weekly, or Monthly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learn">Learn</h2>
<p>This learn section is just an open place for capturing anything important as you learn or create things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We often list resources that we have or know we will need to accomplish our objectives.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
<p>The Plan is the where you keep track of what main steps need to be taken. As
you learn what needs to be done, the path to success presents itself, and you
capture that in Milestones and Goals that need to be reached, and Tasks that
will need to be complete to get to your success criteria.</p>
<p>The Plan section is important to review regularly, as you commit to tasks, and
learn more about your overall dream. This section holds the
&quot;State of your Dream,&quot; meaning that at anytime, you can glance at this section
and see what has been done, and what there is left to do. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="../glossary">glossary</a> for our definition of Plan, Milestones, Goals and Tasks</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="do">Do</h2>
<p>The Do section is all about recording progress, in the form of Commitments and Progress Logs. As you commit to things that you can do that will move your plan along, you can record that commitment in the Commitments List, and as you make progress with something, you can write a little blub in the progress log about the progress that was made. This is especially great for projects where you are working with a group of people. The Do section is meant to be a logs of notes and comments from yourself or the team that is working through.</p>
