                    <h1 id="the-accomplishment-pattern">The Accomplishment Pattern</h1>
<p>After years of working through goal setting and trying to get things done.
A pattern has emerged and solidified. There are 4 main areas that you need
a person needs to focus on if they want to be successful in the acheivements.</p>
<p>If you want to accomplish something, you need to apply this pattern.</p>
<h2 id="dream">Dream</h2>
<p>You must identify and describe your dream, so that you can have a clear vision
of what the future holds.</p>
<h2 id="learn">Learn</h2>
<p>You must do some research about the thing that you are trying to do. You can further shape your dream, as you learn what needs to be done and what others are doing in the same space. </p>
<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
<p>As you learn, a path will reveal itself for what steps you will need to take and resources you will need to have in place to realize the dream you have described. </p>
<h2 id="do">Do</h2>
<p>Committing to working through your plan is essential. Keeping track of what you have done helps you make incremental progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Accomplishment Pattern is the basis of The Accomplishment System</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To leverage the pattern, and be more productive and efficient in achieving your dreams and goals, we have created The Accomplishment System, a flexible set of tools that can be used to make your dreams a reality. </p>
